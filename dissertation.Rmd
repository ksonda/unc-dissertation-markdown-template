<!-- NOTES: 

1. Some template code for formatting based on work from https://github.com/jvcasill/ua_thesis_rmd. All LaTeX code is copied from https://github.com/mmalahe/unc-dissertation including the .cls file.

2. Be careful of unicode characters, especially in the bibliography file. Very hard to find and can kick up errors that prevents the file from compiling. For example, a U+2AB unicode character that was not recognized and kept the program from compiling. or 'Package inputenc Error: Unicode char Î± (U+3B1)', which was actually in a journal title in the .bib file. Dashes are also problematic. See header-unc.tex to avoid that problem and add characters with 'declareunicodecharacters'.
